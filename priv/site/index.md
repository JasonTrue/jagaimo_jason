# Jason Truesdell

Resident of Kawasaki, Japan. I've been here since 2017.

I'm from Seattle, WA, USA. Much of my childhood and all of my post-university adult life prior to moving to Japan was in
or near Seattle. I've also lived in Knoxville, TN, Exton, PA and attended university in Greencastle, IN, and Marburg,
Germany.

My work involves hacking Elixir and occasional C++ and Python at IndustrialML, where I serve as Principal Software
Architect. On paper, I'm the managing director of the Japan subsidiary, IndustrialML GK. This means almost nothing
except when it comes to filing various bits of paperwork, because we're still very small.

In previous lives, I've worked for Microsoft, Zillow, The Seattle Times, Getty Images, and Comcast Technology Solutions.
I've consulted on projects at Dendreon, Windermere, ReallyEnglish, Circlace and others.

I'm sort of an old-school web geek, but all my serious efforts have been for commercial projects, often backend-focused,
and all my personal stuff looks like crap, like my ancient and rusting blog and my made-from-a-hospital-bed
decision-making crowdfunding experiment Ochokochoi.com.
