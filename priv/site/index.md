# Jason Truesdell

Resident of Kawasaki, Japan. I've been here since 2017.

I'm from Seattle, WA, USA. Much of my childhood and all of my post-university adult life prior to moving to Japan was in
or near Seattle. I've also lived in Knoxville, TN, Exton, PA and attended university in Greencastle, IN, and Marburg,
Germany.

I like cooking. And eating. I'm vegetarian. But I'm in Japan, so I have a sense of humor about it.

I spent the last 5 years hacking Elixir and occasional C++ and Python at [IndustrialML](https://industrialml.com/), where I served
as Chief Technology Officer, and before that, Principal Software
Architect, and as managing director of the Japan subsidiary, IndustrialML GK.

Right now my focus is rebuilding my consulting practice. I have a network of experienced
software developers, program managers, architects and UX professionals, and I'm happy to build you
a global team to solve complex business problems. Our sweet spots include
Digital Transformation, Business Process Automation, Industrial Monitoring and Process Management.
My team has done web development, mobile development, IoT firmware, image and audio processing,
and ML pipeline engineering.

I'm also super happy to offer Fractional CTO services, help you set up your first Japan-based
business and engineering office, or give you guidance on growing your team no matter where you are
in the world.

If your company has a problem and you need software to solve it, get in touch with
me.

I'm also starting to think about some product work, namely, ecommerce related to specialty foods/crafts,
and some industrial video capture/computer vision software.

In previous lives, I've worked for Microsoft, Zillow, The Seattle Times, Getty Images, and Comcast Technology Solutions.
I've consulted on projects at Dendreon, Windermere, ReallyEnglish, Circlace and others.

I'm sort of an old-school web geek, but all my serious efforts have been for commercial projects, often backend-focused,
and all my personal stuff looks like crap, like my ancient and rusting blog and my made-from-a-hospital-bed
decision-making crowdfunding experiment [Ochokochoi.com](https://www.ochokochoi.com).
